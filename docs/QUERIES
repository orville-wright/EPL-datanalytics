general notes for mongodb queries
=================================


db = football
collection = fixtures2015

current fixtures2015 datamodel
==============================

Style: EMBEDDED

{
        "_id" : ObjectId("55eb8fbfbb49066b81ceddaa"),
        "fixinfo" : {
                "scorea" : "-",
                "dateandtime" : "26 Dec 15:00",
                "hometeam" : "Man City",
                "winner" : "-",
                "scoreh" : "-",
                "awayteam" : "Sunderland",
                "score" : "-"
        },
        "gameweek" : 18,
        "fixnum" : 5


Example queries:
=================

1) access the normalized (non-embeded) doc structure and find game 10 of gameweek 11...
      db.fixtures2015.find( { gameweek: 11, fixnum: 10 }).pretty()

2) access the embeded doc structure (fixinfo) and find games were Sunderland is at home playing Man City
   using dot syle notation; which is more more readable and nicer...
       db.fixtures2015.find( { "fixinfo.hometeam": "Sunderland", "fixinfo.awayteam": "Man City" } ).pretty()
