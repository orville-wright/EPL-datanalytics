1. Full Player status list ingest
   source URL: http://fantasy.premierleague.com/player-list/
   this URL is a simple html doc provided by Barclays EPL website app
   It loads very quickly because it a very basic page, but its a great rescoruce
   as its kept very up-to-date by Barclays EPL website app.

   - notes: I need to monitor is a decipher when and how frequently they update it.
            Since players price can move by a max of $0.1M per day, this tabel is probably
            updated every 24 hours.
            My planned usage of the data in this URL is to use this as a fast reference
            for accessing player points & value, with a few extra statsu; but I dont plan
            to have 1 single collection with all the player stats info in it. That would end up
            not scaling and probably be slow at scale.

2. Work to do
   - define data mongodb model for player status source URL data
   - probably want more fields in it than the 4 in the URL
   - write code to do the initial ETL of all 4 collumns of data
   - Pump all data into mongodb collection
   - write update code to scan, check and update values on a regaulr period
