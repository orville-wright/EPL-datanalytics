# EPL-datanalytics
English Premier League Data Analytics AI platform

v1.0 of the code is focused on scraping raw data from: http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb.html
and translating it into machine metrics data ready to be loaded into a MondoDB. The MongoDB is
then used as an authourtative data source for advanced analytics.

Additional analytical data doccuments are created within the MonggoDB that are not available
on the website: http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb.html

Also, the MongoDB data source will be use to drive rich analytical charts that are not
available on http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb.html
These charts can graqph info based on the standard dataset from the EPL website as well as
graph additional advance charts.

That EPL website once provided a set of rudamentary charts to user but this service was removed and
Fantasy Footbal players no longer have a supporting charts/grahing service to support making
decisions for they Fantasy Football teams.

More to come.
